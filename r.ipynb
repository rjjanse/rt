        "R is a programming language with a specific focus on statistical programming. A large part of the original R programming language took inspiration from the S programming language, where it also got its name (R being the successor of R in the alphabet). R first appeared in August 1993 and the first official R version 1.0 was released on the 29^th^ of February, 2000 ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))).\n",
